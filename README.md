# 🧠⚕️ BEAST — Multilingual AI Medical Symptom Assistant

> A hybrid clinical-knowledge + symptom-reasoning medical AI that understands real human health queries and returns **clear explanations, practical care steps, and bilingual guidance** — even for rare diseases.

---

# 🚀 Overview

**BEAST (Bilingual Engine for AI Symptom Triage)** is a bulletproof medical query assistant designed to bridge the gap between:

* everyday symptom concerns
* reproductive & intimate health questions
* clinical disease knowledge
* rare medical conditions

Unlike traditional symptom bots that rely only on predefined rules or datasets, BEAST combines:

* medical knowledge bases
* semantic NLP retrieval
* condition reasoning
* universal care generation

to ensure **every user query always receives meaningful guidance**.

---

# 🎯 Problem

Most medical chatbots fail because they:

* cannot understand natural symptom language
* ignore reproductive / sensitive health
* return long clinical text without care advice
* lack coverage for both common and rare conditions
* provide no response when dataset mismatch occurs

This leads to unsafe or unusable outputs.

# 💡 Solution

BEAST introduces a hybrid medical intelligence architecture:

1. **Symptom Detection Engine**
   Interprets real-world phrasing
   (e.g., “my head hurts”, “reddish sperm”, “vaginal smell”)

2. **Clinical Knowledge Retrieval**
   Uses MedQuAD biomedical dataset for disease grounding

3. **Consumer Health Layer**
   Covers everyday symptoms & lifestyle issues

4. **Reproductive & Intimate Health Module**
   Explicit coverage of sensitive queries often ignored

5. **Condition-Specific Care Library**
   Structured summaries, causes, and actionable care

6. **Universal Medical Fallback Engine**
   Guarantees solutions even for unknown or rare diseases

7. **Bilingual Response System**
   Automatic Hindi ↔ English understanding and output
